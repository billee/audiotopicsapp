# Background Images Enhancement Requirements

## Introduction

Currently, the audio topics application uses plain black backgrounds across all pages, which creates a monotonous and less engaging user experience. This feature will implement attractive background images for each page to enhance the visual appeal and create a more immersive experience for users browsing audio content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see attractive background images on each page instead of plain black backgrounds, so that the app feels more visually appealing and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the Category Screen THEN I SHALL see an attractive background image that complements the audio topics theme
2. WHEN I navigate to the Topic List Screen THEN I SHALL see a background image that relates to the selected category
3. WHEN I navigate to the Audio Player Screen THEN I SHALL see a background image that enhances the listening experience
4. WHEN background images are displayed THEN they SHALL maintain proper contrast with text content for readability
5. WHEN background images load THEN they SHALL not impact app performance or loading times significantly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want background images to be contextually relevant to the content I'm viewing, so that the visual experience feels cohesive and purposeful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the main Category Screen THEN the background SHALL reflect the general theme of audio learning/education
2. WHEN I view a specific category's topics THEN the background SHALL relate to that category's subject matter
3. WHEN I'm listening to audio content THEN the background SHALL create an ambient, focused listening environment
4. WHEN background images are selected THEN they SHALL be high quality and appropriate for the app's professional tone

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want background images to work well across different devices and orientations, so that the visual experience is consistent regardless of how I use the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I rotate my device THEN background images SHALL adapt properly to both portrait and landscape orientations
2. WHEN I use the app on different screen sizes THEN background images SHALL scale appropriately without distortion
3. WHEN background images are displayed THEN they SHALL maintain aspect ratios and avoid stretching or pixelation
4. WHEN I navigate between pages THEN background transitions SHALL be smooth and not jarring

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want background images to enhance readability rather than interfere with it, so that I can easily read all text content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN background images are displayed THEN text content SHALL remain clearly readable with sufficient contrast
2. WHEN overlays are needed THEN they SHALL be applied to ensure text visibility without completely obscuring the background
3. WHEN background images are bright or busy THEN appropriate darkening or blurring effects SHALL be applied
4. WHEN users have accessibility needs THEN background images SHALL not interfere with screen readers or other assistive technologies
