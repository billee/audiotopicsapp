- [x] 3. Set up background image assets and utilities





  - Create background image asset organization structure
  - Implement image utility functions for URL generation and validation
  - Add high-quality background images for different contexts (category, topic-list, audio-player)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 4. Integrate background images into CategoryScreen





  - Replace black background with attractive audio/education themed background image
  - Implement proper overlay to ensure category card readability
  - Add responsive behavior for different screen sizes and orientations
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 5. Add contextual backgrounds to TopicListScreen














  - Implement category-specific background images (Technology, Science, History themes)
  - Ensure background images complement the category branding and color scheme
  - Add proper overlay and contrast management for topic list readability
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 1.4, 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 6. Enhance AudioPlayerScreen with ambient backgrounds
  - Replace black background with calming, focus-enhancing background images
  - Implement topic-specific backgrounds when available, with ambient fallbacks
  - Ensure audio controls remain clearly visible with proper contrast
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 1.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 7. Implement responsive design and performance optimization
  - Add proper image scaling and aspect ratio handling for all screen sizes
  - Implement image caching and lazy loading for optimal performance
  - Ensure smooth transitions between background images during navigation
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 1.5_

- [ ] 8. Add accessibility and contrast management
  - Implement dynamic overlay opacity based on background image brightness
  - Ensure minimum contrast ratios for all text content over backgrounds
  - Add accessibility support and alternative descriptions for background images
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 9. Create comprehensive error handling and fallbacks
  - Implement graceful fallback to solid colors when images fail to load
  - Add loading states and error recovery mechanisms
  - Create offline-first approach with local asset fallbacks
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 3.4_

- [ ] 10. Write comprehensive tests for background image system
  - Create unit tests for BackgroundImage component and useBackgroundImage hook
  - Add integration tests for background image loading and display across screens
  - Implement performance tests to ensure no significant impact on app loading times
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 11. Fine-tune visual design and user experience
  - Optimize overlay opacity and contrast for each background context
  - Ensure consistent visual hierarchy and branding across all backgrounds
  - Test and refine background image selection for optimal user experience
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 4.1, 4.2, 1.4_

- [ ] 12. Integrate and test complete background image system
  - Wire together all background image components and ensure seamless integration
  - Test background image system across different devices, orientations, and network conditions
  - Validate that all requirements are met and the black backgrounds are successfully replaced
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_
