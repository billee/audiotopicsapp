# Filipino Categories Implementation Requirements

## Introduction

This feature will replace the current English categories (Technology, Science, History, Arts, Business, Health) with Filipino-focused categories that are more meaningful and relevant to Filipino users. The categories will be stored in a separate configuration file for easy management and updates.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Filipino Category Names

**User Story:** As a Filipino user, I want to see category names in Filipino language that are relevant to my culture and daily life, so that I can easily find content that resonates with me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app displays categories THEN it SHALL show Filipino category names instead of English ones
2. WHEN a user views the category list THEN it SHALL display the following Filipino categories:
   - "Pamilya at Sariling Buhay"
   - "Araw-araw na Pamumuhay" 
   - "Mga-Kasalukuyang-Balita"
   - "Damdamin at Relasyon"
   - "Mga Plano at Pagkakataon"
   - "Libangan at Kasiyahan"
   - "Mga Alaala at Nostalgia"
3. WHEN categories are displayed THEN they SHALL maintain proper Filipino grammar and spelling
4. WHEN categories are shown THEN they SHALL be culturally appropriate and meaningful to Filipino users

### Requirement 2: Separate Configuration File

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want category configurations to be in a separate file, so that I can easily modify category names, descriptions, and mappings without touching complex code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN categories need to be modified THEN they SHALL be stored in a dedicated configuration file
2. WHEN the configuration file is updated THEN changes SHALL be reflected in the app immediately
3. WHEN viewing the configuration file THEN it SHALL contain:
   - Category IDs (numeric)
   - Filipino category names
   - English translations (for reference)
   - Category descriptions in Filipino
   - Background image mappings
4. WHEN developers need to reference categories THEN they SHALL import from the configuration file
5. WHEN the configuration is changed THEN it SHALL not require code changes in other files

### Requirement 3: Background Image Mapping

**User Story:** As a user, I want each Filipino category to have appropriate background images, so that the visual experience matches the category content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a category is selected THEN it SHALL display an appropriate background image
2. WHEN background images are configured THEN they SHALL map to the new Filipino categories
3. WHEN no specific background exists THEN it SHALL fall back to a default image
4. WHEN background mappings are updated THEN they SHALL be easily modifiable in the configuration file

### Requirement 4: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the category system to maintain backward compatibility, so that existing functionality continues to work during the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new categories are implemented THEN existing category IDs SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN old category references exist THEN they SHALL map to appropriate new categories
3. WHEN the system encounters unmapped categories THEN it SHALL provide sensible defaults
4. WHEN migrating data THEN existing content SHALL be properly categorized under new system

### Requirement 5: Beautiful Filipino-Inspired Layout

**User Story:** As a Filipino user, I want to see all categories displayed in a beautiful, non-scrolling layout that appeals to Filipino aesthetic preferences, so that I can easily browse and select categories in an visually pleasing way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the categories page THEN all 7 categories SHALL be visible without scrolling
2. WHEN categories are displayed THEN they SHALL use a layout that appeals to Filipino design tastes

   - Beautiful background images or colors
   - Clear, readable Filipino text
   - Intuitive visual hierarchy
   - Warm, welcoming color schemes preferred by Filipinos
5. WHEN users interact with categories THEN the layout SHALL provide smooth, responsive interactions
6. WHEN the screen orientation changes THEN the layout SHALL adapt gracefully
7. WHEN categories are displayed THEN they SHALL use visual elements that resonate with Filipino culture (colors, patterns, imagery)

### Requirement 6: Easy Management Interface

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to easily understand and modify the category configuration, so that I can make updates without technical assistance.
