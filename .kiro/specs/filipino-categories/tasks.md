# Implementation Plan

Convert the Filipino categories design into a series of prompts for a code-generation LLM that will implement each step in a test-driven manner. Prioritize best practices, incremental progress, and early testing, ensuring no big jumps in complexity at any stage. Make sure that each prompt builds on the previous prompts, and ends with wiring things together. There should be no hanging or orphaned code that isn't integrated into a previous step. Focus ONLY on tasks that involve writing, modifying, or testing code.

- [ ] 4. Create CategoryGrid component
  - Create `src/components/categories/CategoryGrid.tsx` for the main grid layout

  - Ensure all 7 categories are visible without scrolling on mobile screens
  - Implement smooth animations and transitions for category selection
  - Write component tests for layout rendering, responsiveness, and user interactions
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5, 5.6_

- [ ] 5. Integrate background image system
  - Update `src/assets/backgrounds/index.ts` to support Filipino category mappings
  - Modify background resolution functions to work with new category IDs
  - Create mapping between Filipino category IDs and existing background images
  - Implement fallback system for missing background images
  - Add support for category-specific background colors as fallbacks
  - Write integration tests for background image resolution with new categories
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 6. Update CategoryScreen with Filipino layout
  - Modify `src/screens/CategoryScreen.tsx` to use new Filipino categories and components

- [ ] 7. Implement backward compatibility layer
  - Update existing code that references old category IDs to work with new system
  - Create migration utilities for any stored category preferences or data
  - Implement mapping functions to convert between old and new category systems
  - Add deprecation warnings for old category usage (if applicable)
  - Ensure all existing functionality continues to work seamlessly
  - Write comprehensive tests for backward compatibility scenarios
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_
