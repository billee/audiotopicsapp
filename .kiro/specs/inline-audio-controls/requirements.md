# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the topic list user experience by adding inline audio controls (play, pause, stop) directly to each topic row, eliminating the need to navigate to a separate audio player screen. Users can play audio content directly from the topic list page, with the page being vertically scrollable to accommodate multiple audio topics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user browsing topics in a category, I want to see play/pause/stop controls for each audio topic directly in the list, so that I can quickly listen to content without navigating to another screen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the topic list page THEN each topic row SHALL display inline audio controls (play, pause, stop buttons)
2. WHEN a user clicks the play button THEN the audio SHALL start playing immediately without navigation
3. WHEN audio is playing THEN the play button SHALL change to a pause button
4. WHEN a user clicks the pause button THEN the audio SHALL pause and the button SHALL revert to a play button
5. WHEN a user clicks the stop button THEN the audio SHALL stop and reset to the beginning

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with multiple audio topics in a category, I want the page to be vertically scrollable, so that I can access all available audio content easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there are multiple audio topics THEN the page SHALL be vertically scrollable
2. WHEN scrolling through topics THEN all inline audio controls SHALL remain functional
3. WHEN the page loads THEN all topics SHALL be visible through scrolling without horizontal overflow

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user playing audio from the topic list, I want only one audio to play at a time, so that I don't have overlapping audio content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts playing an audio topic THEN any currently playing audio SHALL automatically stop
2. WHEN switching between audio topics THEN the previous audio SHALL stop and the new audio SHALL start
3. WHEN an audio finishes playing THEN the controls SHALL reset to the initial state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user interacting with audio controls, I want visual feedback on the current playback state, so that I can understand what's happening with the audio.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio is playing THEN the current topic row SHALL show a visual indicator of active playback
2. WHEN audio is paused THEN the topic row SHALL show a paused state indicator
3. WHEN audio is loading THEN the controls SHALL show a loading state
4. WHEN there's an audio error THEN the user SHALL see an error indicator with the option to retry

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user on a mobile device, I want the inline audio controls to be touch-friendly and accessible, so that I can easily interact with them on smaller screens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using touch devices THEN all audio control buttons SHALL be appropriately sized for touch interaction
2. WHEN using the controls THEN they SHALL provide haptic feedback where supported
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN all audio controls SHALL have proper accessibility labels
4. WHEN the page is viewed on different screen sizes THEN the audio controls SHALL remain functional and properly positioned
