## Running the App

### Option 1: Using the Test Script (Recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd AudioTopicsApp

# Run the Windows test script
scripts\test-android.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual Steps

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd AudioTopicsApp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Clean previous builds
npx react-native clean

npx react-native start

# Build and run on Android (in another terminal)
npx react-native run-android
```

## Testing the Mini Player

### Core Functionality Tests

#### 1. Basic Playback Test

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### App Won't Install
```bash
# Clear app data and reinstall
adb uninstall com.audiotopicsapp
npx react-native run-android
```

#### Audio Not Playing
- Check device volume levels
- Verify audio permissions in app settings
- Check if device is in silent/do-not-disturb mode

#### Mini Player Not Appearing
- Check Redux store state in React Native debugger
- Verify audio is actually playing
- Check console logs for JavaScript errors

#### Background Audio Not Working
- Verify Android manifest permissions
- Check if battery optimization is disabled for the app
- Ensure foreground service is properly configured

#### Notification Controls Not Working
- Check notification permissions in Android settings
- Verify media session is properly initialized
- Check if notification channels are created (Android 8+)

### Debug Commands

#### View App Logs
```bash
# Filter for your app's logs
adb logcat | findstr "AudioTopicsApp"

# Filter for audio-related logs
adb logcat | findstr /i "audio"

# Filter for media session logs
adb logcat | findstr "MediaSession"
```

#### Check App Permissions
```bash
# List all permissions for your app
adb shell dumpsys package com.audiotopicsapp | findstr permission
```

#### Monitor Audio Focus
```bash
# Monitor audio focus changes
adb logcat | findstr "AudioFocus"
```

## Performance Testing

### Battery Usage Test
1. Start audio playback
2. Background the app for 30 minutes
3. Check battery usage in Android Settings > Battery
4. Verify reasonable battery consumption

### Memory Usage Test
1. Use Android Studio's Memory Profiler
2. Monitor memory usage during:
   - Normal playback
   - Background playback
   - Mini player interactions
3. Look for memory leaks or excessive usage

### Network Usage Test
1. Monitor network usage during streaming
2. Test behavior with poor network conditions
3. Verify proper error handling for network issues

## Expected Behavior Summary

### ‚úÖ What Should Work
- Mini player appears when audio starts and user navigates away
- All mini player controls function correctly
- Background audio playback continues when app is backgrounded
- Notification controls work in notification panel
- Lock screen controls are functional
- Audio focus is properly managed with other apps
- Smooth animations and responsive UI

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations
- Some Android versions may have different notification behavior
