# Background Image Issue Debugging Checklist

## Current Status
✅ Disabled responsive images in TopicListScreen  
✅ Added comprehensive console logging  
✅ Improved error handling with specific messages  
✅ Changed science category to use working URL  
✅ Added retry mechanism with better state management  

## What to Check When Running the App

### 1. Console Logs to Look For
When navigating to science category → topic:
```
TopicListScreen categoryId: 2
getRemoteUrlByContext called with: topic-list 2
Mapped categoryId 2 to categoryName: science
Found background URL for science : [URL]
TopicListScreen backgroundImageUrl: [URL]
```

### 2. Expected Behavior
- ✅ Science category should now load without "failed to download" error
- ✅ Background should show (using the same URL as default category)
- ✅ No responsive URL generation (disabled temporarily)

### 3. If Still Failing
Check console for:
- Network errors
- FastImage specific errors
- Any other error messages

### 4. Next Steps Based on Results

**If it works now:**
- The issue was with the original Unsplash URL or responsive URL generation
- Can gradually re-enable responsive images and test

**If it still fails:**
- Issue might be with FastImage configuration
- Network connectivity problems
- Need to implement the fallback system

## Quick Fixes Applied
1. **URL Change**: Science category now uses proven working URL
2. **Responsive Disabled**: Bypasses complex URL generation
3. **Better Logging**: Can track exactly what's happening
4. **Error Details**: More specific error messages

## Rollback Plan
If needed, can quickly revert by:
1. Re-enabling responsive images
2. Restoring original science category URL
3. Removing debug logging
