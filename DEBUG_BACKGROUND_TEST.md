# Background Image Debug Information

## Issue Analysis
The user is experiencing a "failed to download the background" error when navigating to the science category and clicking on a topic.

## Debugging Steps Implemented

### 1. Added Console Logging
- Added logging to `getRemoteUrlByContext` to track URL resolution
- Added logging to `TopicListScreen` to show categoryId and backgroundImageUrl
- Added logging to `BackgroundImage` component error handler

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Enhanced error messages to show specific error details
- Added try-catch blocks around responsive URL generation
- Added fallback logic when responsive URL generation fails

### 3. Temporary Fixes Applied
- Disabled responsive images in TopicListScreen (`enableResponsiveImages={false}`)
- This should bypass the responsive URL generation and use original URLs

### 4. URL Generation Analysis
For science category (categoryId: "2"):
- Maps to categoryName: "science"
- Should use URL: `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1532094349884-543bc11b234d?w=800&h=600&fit=crop&crop=center`

## Expected Console Output
When navigating to science category, you should see:
```
TopicListScreen categoryId: 2
getRemoteUrlByContext called with: topic-list 2
Mapped categoryId 2 to categoryName: science
Found background URL for science : https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1532094349884-543bc11b234d?w=800&h=600&fit=crop&crop=center
TopicListScreen backgroundImageUrl: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1532094349884-543bc11b234d?w=800&h=600&fit=crop&crop=center
```

## Next Steps
1. Check the console logs to verify the URL being generated
2. If the URL is correct but still failing, the issue might be:
   - Network connectivity
   - Unsplash API rate limiting
   - Invalid Unsplash image ID
3. If needed, we can replace the Unsplash URL with a more reliable image source

## Fallback Solution
If the issue persists, we can:
1. Use local images instead of remote URLs
2. Use a different image hosting service
3. Add a more robust retry mechanism
