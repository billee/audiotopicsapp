# Navigation Debug Guide

## Current Status

✅ **Navigation Setup**: React Navigation is now configured with proper stack navigation
✅ **Gesture Handler**: Added to index.js for Android compatibility  
✅ **Screens**: All screens (CategoryScreen, TopicListScreen, AudioPlayerScreen) are connected
✅ **Mini Player**: Integrated as overlay above navigation

## Testing Navigation Flow

### Expected Flow:
1. **Categories Screen** → Shows 6 category cards
2. **Click Category** → Navigates to TopicListScreen with topics for that category
3. **Click Topic** → Navigates to AudioPlayerScreen and starts playing
4. **Mini Player** → Should appear when audio starts and you navigate back

### If Categories Don't Navigate:

Check the Metro bundler console for errors. Common issues:

1. **Redux Store Issues**: Categories might not be loaded
2. **Navigation Errors**: Check if gesture handler is working
3. **Missing Data**: Categories might not have proper navigation data

### Debug Steps:

1. **Check Metro Console**:
   ```bash
   # Look for errors in the Metro bundler terminal
   # Common errors: "Cannot read property 'navigate' of undefined"
   ```

2. **Check Device Logs**:
   ```bash
   adb logcat | findstr "ReactNativeJS"
   ```

3. **Test Navigation Manually**:
   - Open React Native debugger
   - Check if categories are loaded in Redux store
   - Verify navigation prop is passed to CategoryScreen

## Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Restart Metro Bundler
```bash
# Stop current Metro bundler (Ctrl+C)
# Clear cache and restart
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

### Fix 2: Rebuild App
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
npx react-native clean
npx react-native run-android
```

### Fix 3: Check Dependencies
```bash
# Ensure all navigation dependencies are installed
npm install
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Categories Screen**: Shows 6 categories with proper styling
2. **Category Tap**: Should navigate to TopicListScreen with header showing category name
3. **Topic List**: Should show list of topics for that category
4. **Topic Tap**: Should navigate to AudioPlayerScreen
5. **Audio Player**: Should show topic info and controls
6. **Mini Player**: Should appear when you navigate back while audio is playing

## If Still Not Working

The issue might be:

1. **Missing Mock Data**: Categories or topics might not have proper mock data
2. **Redux State**: Store might not be properly initialized
3. **Component Errors**: Individual components might have rendering issues

Let me know what you see in the Metro console and I can help debug further!

## Testing Mini Player Specifically

Once navigation works:

1. Navigate to AudioPlayerScreen
2. Start playing audio (tap play button)
3. Navigate back to categories or topic list
4. **Expected**: Mini player should appear at bottom
5. Test mini player controls
6. Test tap-to-expand functionality

The mini player implementation is complete - it just needs the navigation to work properly to test it!
