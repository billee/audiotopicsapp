# JavaScript Error Fix - "right operand of 'in' is not an object"

## Problem Identified
The error "TypeError: right operand of 'in' is not an object" was occurring in the BackgroundImage component because the code was trying to use the `in` operator on `null` values.

## Root Cause
When the science category was set to use `null` as the source (to force fallback color), the BackgroundImage component had multiple places where it checked:
```typescript
typeof source === 'object' && 'uri' in source
```

When `source` is `null`, `typeof null === 'object'` returns `true`, but `'uri' in null` throws an error because you cannot use the `in` operator on `null`.

## Solution Applied
Fixed all occurrences by adding proper null checks:

### Before (Problematic):
```typescript
typeof source === 'object' && 'uri' in source
```

### After (Fixed):
```typescript
source && typeof source === 'object' && source !== null && 'uri' in source
```

## Files Modified
- `src/components/common/BackgroundImage.tsx` - Fixed 5 occurrences of the problematic `in` operator usage

## Locations Fixed
1. `getOptimalImageSource` function - line ~121
2. `handleLoadStart` function - line ~164  
3. `handleLoad` function - line ~192
4. `handleError` function - line ~228
5. `useEffect` for source changes - lines ~261 and ~264

## Expected Result
- ✅ No more JavaScript errors in console
- ✅ Science category displays green gradient background correctly
- ✅ All other categories continue to work normally
- ✅ Proper null handling throughout the component

## Test Status
The fix ensures that when `source` is `null` (as intended for science category), the component gracefully handles it and shows the fallback background without throwing JavaScript errors.
